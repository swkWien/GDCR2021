## Pen & Paper

Before we start coding, let's think.

Familiarize yourself with the problem:
* Find a common language.
* Identify concepts.
* Make a sketch.
* Be explicit.

### Tips

* Sometimes "A picture is worth a thousand words".
* If you prefer a digital sketching solution: https://cocreate.csail.mit.edu/.

### Extra Challenge

Optional, for experienced participants:

* Use your *left* hand.

Not recommended, only for crazy participants:

* Use your feet.
