# Write smaller code! 

Facilitator: Rea Sutter

---

## Minimalist Code
- max. 3 statements per method
- max. 5 methods per class

---

### Tips
- you can write longer methods and larger classes first,<br>
but **refactor** as soon as your tests are green
- depending on your language, you can go even smaller
