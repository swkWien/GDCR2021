## Constraint TDD/Ping Pong

Let's do TDD and Pair Programming in a strict way, switching after each increment:

* A writes a test and sees that it fails.
* B writes the code needed to pass the test.
* A (or B) refactors the code as needed.
* B writes next test and sees that it fails.
* A writes the code needed to pass the test.
* And so on.

---

### Tips

* Use the first few minutes to decide on approach and create an initial test list.
* Make sure to see the test red or green before passing the keyboard to one another.

### Extra Challenge (optional, for experienced participants)

* Don't use a mouse or keypad.

### Extra Extra Challenge (not recommended, only for crazy participants)

* No moving cursor more than 2 lines with the arrow keys.
* No typing Enter/Backspace/any key more than 2 times at once.
