## Take Baby Steps!

---

## Why Should I
## Take Baby Steps?

- Your 🧠 is limited
- A free mind works better
- Ingenuity seldom works
- Steady progress feels great

---

## TDD Baby Steps Flow

- Choose a step
- Set timer
- Code!
- 🤓 Works?
  - → Repeat
- ⏲ Time out?
  - `reset --hard`
  - Make the step smaller!
  - → Repeat

---

## But How Small?

- The test turned green?
  - → **commit**
  - refactor separately
- The code is better than before?
  - → **commit**
  - make additional refactorings

> Commit often - "micro commits"
