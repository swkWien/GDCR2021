🍎 + 🐍 + 🕹️ → 💯 Our Kata 🍎 + 🐍 + 🕹️ → 💯 = Snake! https://g.co/kgs/5Sxo4e
A snake moves. The player makes it turn. Collect points by eating apples. If the snake runs into a wall or itself, the game is over. Implement a console game.

Pen &amp;amp; Paper Before we start coding, let&amp;rsquo;s think.
Familiarize yourself with the problem:
Find a common language. Identify concepts. Make a sketch. Be explicit. Tips Introduce terminology. &amp;ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words&amp;rdquo;. If you prefer a digital sketching solution: https://cocreate.csail.mit.edu/. 🤝 Find a Pair 📝 Pen &amp;amp; Paper 🤔 Retrospective What have you learned about the game?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session2_tdd_ping_pong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session2_tdd_ping_pong/</guid><description>Session 2 First attempt to make small steps Facilitator: Peter Kofler, @codecopkofler
🏓 TDD with Ping Pong Let&amp;rsquo;s do TDD and Pair Programming in a strict way,
switching after each increment:
A writes a test and sees that it fails. B writes the code needed to pass the test. A (or B) refactors the code as needed. B writes the next test and sees that it fails. A writes the code needed to pass the test.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session3_tdd_baby_steps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session3_tdd_baby_steps/</guid><description>Session 3 Make Even Smaller Steps! Facilitator: Paul Rohorzka, @paulroho
Take Baby Steps! Why Baby Steps? Your 🧠 is limited. A clear head works better. Ingenuity seldom works. Steady progress feels great. TDD Baby Steps Flow Decide on a step.
Set a 3 minute timer.
Code!
🤓 Works?
→ Repeat ⏲ Time out?
reset --hard Make the step smaller!</description></item><item><title/><link>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session4_minimalist_coder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session4_minimalist_coder/</guid><description>Session 4 Write smaller units! Facilitator: Rea Sutter
🤏 Minimalist Code Max. 3 fields per class Max. 3 methods per class Max. 3 statements per method Tips Refactor to keep units small
Extract variable Extract method Extract class 🤝 Find a Pair 💻 Coding Pair Programming TDD Focus on Constraints 🤔 Retrospective How did this approach affect
the readability of your code?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session5_tcr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/session5_tcr/</guid><description>Session 5 TCR Test Commit Revert Facilitator: Adam Zielinski, @adam0x5A
test &amp;amp;&amp;amp; commit || revert The new style versus test-driven development
TCR - why? Limbo lower now - Limbo lower now - How low can you go?
If you don’t want a bunch of code wiped out then don’t write a bunch of code between greens.
TCR - how? Add test and pass. The goal here is to shorten the time between idea and some kind of test passing in some kind of way.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/thankyou/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swkwien.github.io/GDCR2021/home/thankyou/</guid><description> 🤔 Final Retrospective What did you learn?
